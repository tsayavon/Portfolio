# [Project 1: Discount Mart](https://public.tableau.com/views/Project_1_DiscountMartSales/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
* Discount Mart is a small supermarket owned by Grant Frost.
* Created an interactive Tableau dashboard where we're able to track how well Discount Mart is doing for 2016-2019 in terms of Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold.
* We will be able to see how well categories are performing as well as different regions.
* It is assumed that most customers buy 2 or more products per basket/order, can be confirmed by the data.
* Profit is 30% of the selling price.

# [Project 2: Green Destinations (HR Analytics)](https://public.tableau.com/views/HRAnalytics-GreenDestination/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Green Destinations is a well known travel agency. The HR Director has recently noticed an increase in employees leaving (attrition). She would like to figure out any trends or 
patterns. She has surveyed the staff of Green Destinations and provided you with the data. She would like to know what the attrition rate is (% of people who have left). 
She would also like to know if factors like age, years at the company and income play a part in determining if people will leave or not.

I was able to create a Tableau dashboard from the data provided. There, we will see how many employees are employed at Green Destinations, the employee rate, the average job satisfaction, and average month income. The bar graphs show the attrition dates by age group, monthly income, average income per age, and employee count by years worked.
